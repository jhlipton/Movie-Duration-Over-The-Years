# Movie_data
Min, Max and Mean duration of movies over the years

### I was wondering if movies have gotten longer, or if they just feel that way.

Data is from **Chuan Sun** (https://www.kaggle.com/deepmatrix)'s entry on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/deepmatrix/imdb-5000-movie-dataset
  the raw data is here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sundeepblue/movie_rating_prediction/master/movie_metadata.csv

I used pandas and numpy to create Pivot Tables of the minimum, maximum and mean duration for every year, then used matplotlib.pyplot to plot. Using these libraries makes the program very simple.
